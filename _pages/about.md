I am a postdoctoral researcher in [Ev Fedorenko’s Language Lab (EvLab)](https://www.evlab.mit.edu/) at MIT.
In my work I explore the characteristics of the neural system supporting the natural langauge processing, and its relationship to speech articulation and speech perception. I also work on topics related to bilingualism trying to understand how language system supports and organizes two languages in one mind.
