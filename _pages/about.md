I am a **postdoctoral researcher** in [Ev Fedorenko’s Language Lab (EvLab)](https://www.evlab.mit.edu/) at MIT.
In my work I explore the characteristics of the neural system supporting the natural langauge processing, and its relationship to speech articulation and speech perception. I also work on topics related to bilingualism trying to understand how language system supports and organizes two languages in one mind.

I completed by Ph.D. in [Cognitive Neuroscience Program](https://cognes.uj.edu.pl) at the Jagiellonian University in Kraków where I worked with Prof. Zofia Wodniecka in the [Psychology of Language and Bilingualism Lab](https://langusta.psychologia.uj.edu.pl/).
