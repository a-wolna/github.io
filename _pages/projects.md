## Neural basis of speech articulation and high-level language processing
---
In this line of my research I explore the functional specialization of the speech-articulation and high-level language system. Since speech production has often been studied using paradigms that conflate language processing and articulation (e.g., picture naming), it is unclear to what extent these two functions rely on independent or overlapping mechanisms.

The **aims of this project** include:  
➡️ developping a speech articulation localizer paradigms, which would allow to efficiently identify articulation regions without using language stimuli  
➡️ characterizing functional profiles of the articulation regions relative to the neighbouring high-level language areas  

**key results:**  
Speech articulation engages a bilateral set of temporal and sensimotor regions which show very different functional profiles than the fronto-temporal language system:

Look out for a preprint comming soon!

## Characterization of the non-canonical language regions in the brain
---
In this line of my research I study the characteristics of the high-level language system in the brain, including, but not limited to:  

➡️ identification and characterization of the non-canonical language regions
- **key papers:**  
   - the "extended language network": characterization of non-canonical regions responding to language [preprint](/files/publications/2025-biorxiv-ExtendedLanguageNetwork.pdf)  
   - langauge in the cerebellum (led by Colton Casto) [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.14.645351v1)  

➡️ the lateralization of langauge & its relationship to the lateralization of the neighbouring speech articulation and speech perception systems  

## Brain basis of bilingualism

Coming soon!

## Interesting brains
---
What are the limits of functional specialization in the brain? How does it look like in anatomically atypical brains? In this project we ask this question by looking at a very special population: individuals with significant innate or early lesions in the brain (including cysts of different origins, early stroke, and surgical resections) who despite their unique anatomy live largely symptom-free lives.
